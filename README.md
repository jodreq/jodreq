- Hi, I am Joshua Drew
- This repo houses the prototype display for machine status on packaging lines at a pharmaceutical company. 
- Consists of REST APIs (servers) that communicate with clients (Kepware REST Client) which read tags from the individual machine's PLC.
- The main web app which serves the display utilizes AJAX requests to the REST APIs for dynamic updates of machine state and alarm status.
